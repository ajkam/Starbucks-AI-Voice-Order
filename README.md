This project focuses on developing a voice-activated ordering system for Starbucks, leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to enhance the customer ordering experience.

## Overview

The Starbucks Voice Order Project aims to simplify and expedite the ordering process for customers by allowing them to place orders using voice commands. This system interprets spoken orders, processes them to identify items, sizes, and customizations, and interfaces with the existing Starbucks ordering infrastructure.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Captures and transcribes customer voice inputs accurately.
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Parses transcribed text to extract order details such as beverage type, size, add-ons, and special instructions.
- **Order Confirmation**: Provides real-time feedback to customers, confirming the interpreted order before processing.
- **Integration with Ordering System**: Interfaces seamlessly with Starbucks' existing ordering and payment systems.

## Project Structure

- **Introduction**: Overview of the project goals and Starbucks' strategic alignment.
- **Background**: Insight into Starbucks' existing AI capabilities and the need for voice ordering in drive-thrus.
- **SWOT Analysis**: Analysis of Starbucks' strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to the implementation of the voice-ordering system.
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Methods used for collecting and preparing data, including noise reduction, tokenization, and normalization.
- **Model Selection**: Justification for using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks due to their effectiveness in handling sequential data and long-range dependencies.
- **Evaluation of Models**: Evaluation metrics such as Word Error Rate (WER) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) used to assess model performance.
- **Product Architecture**: The technical architecture of the voice-ordering system, including frontend, backend, and database layers.
- **Business Case**: Alignment with Starbucks' Triple Shot Reinvention Strategy, projected cost savings, and return on investment (ROI).
- **Risks and Mitigation**: Identification of potential risks and strategies for mitigating them.
- **Future Enhancements**: Suggestions for expanding the system's capabilities, including multilingual support, personalization, and accessibility features.
